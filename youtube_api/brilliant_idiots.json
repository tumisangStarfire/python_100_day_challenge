                    "description": "This week Andrew, Charlamagne and Wax went from speaking about social media and how it is ruining us to Charlamagne commenting on who and what is overrated now a days. Also, in between discussions, Charlamagne proposed a question about his sexuality which turned into Schulz and Charla being concerned about Wax\u2019s well being because his thought process seemed more off than usual. Moreover, near the end of the show they had surprise guest Makaela, one of Charlamagne\u2019s nieces stop by and lets just say Andrew was very intrigued by Makaela\u2019s recent makeover.\n\nVideo By https://www.instagram.com/alexxmedia\n\nThe Brilliant Idiots is a comedy podcast from the Loud Speakers Network featuring Charlamagne tha God, host of Power 105.1\u2019s radio show, The Breakfast Club.

Also, during the show they discuss Cardi B\u2019s success in her lawsuit with YouTuber Tasha K, and how it should be a lesson for people to be mindful about certain things they spread online, but of course Andrew gave some pushback towards it. Also, even after an unfortunate lost, they still believe Tom Brady is the best athlete of all time, and even tried to compare others to him, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there is a match. Lastly, they end the show with some \u201cAsk an idiot\u201d questions, with one asking who Andrew and Charlamagne would do a versuz with in their career in comedy and radio/tv personality.\n\nThe Brilliant Idiots is a comedy podcast from the Loud Speakers Network featuring Charlamagne tha God, host of Power 105.1\u2019s radio show, The Breakfast Club.
